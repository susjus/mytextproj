-- Because we used EXTRACTION_CORE configuration, entities such as PERSON, PRODUCT, DATE, URL, COUNTRY etc. were extracted from the unstructured data. Letâ€™s investigate further what kind of PRODUCTs were mentioned the most in user tweets. Execute the following query:
SELECT TA_TOKEN, count(*)
FROM "$TA_FT_TWEETS"
WHERE TA_TYPE = 'PRODUCT'
GROUP BY TA_TOKEN
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
